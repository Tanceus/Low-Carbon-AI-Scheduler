Low-Carbon AI Scheduler üåç‚ö°

Overview
This project demonstrates how AI can support **sustainable energy scheduling** by forecasting CO‚ÇÇ emissions and recommending low-carbon operation windows.

- Built with **Python, Prophet (forecasting), and Streamlit (dashboard)**.
- Uses **mock live carbon intensity data (JSON)** to simulate real-time inputs.
- Outputs: Forecast charts, live carbon metric, energy mix visualization.

 Why Streamlit?
- Quick, interactive web dashboard.
- Easy to visualize metrics, plots, and real-time JSON updates.
- No heavy frontend coding required.

Why Prophet?
- Industry-standard time series forecasting tool (developed by Facebook).
- Handles trends, seasonality, and uncertainty ranges.
- Easy to explain in presentations.
